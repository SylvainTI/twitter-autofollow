Finding new people to follow on twitter is one challenge I have been trying to overcome. I wanted a way to specify a search term (e.g. a keyword of one of my interests, such as "soccer") and automatically follow any user who has tweeted with that term.

This brings a multitude of new users I would otherwise have not discovered, and I can then pick and choose which ones I will continue to follow.

This project is the way in which I have implemented it. At present, it consists of a simple PHP script that can be configured and then run manually or run via a cron job at set intervals.

Requires CURL.
